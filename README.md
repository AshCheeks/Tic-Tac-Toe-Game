This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user can decide to play with a friend or a simple AI.

The User must choose a designated symbol and who their desired opponent will be. (COMPUTER or PLAYER)

I currently have 2 app.js files.

## DISCLAIMER

- Computer AI player is still wonky. It's a work in progress that I shall improve over time. (:

Thanks for understanding - to future Ash <3
